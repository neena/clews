= ClEWS, the clever EWS

An EHR built on Ruby on Rails that can take a HL7 feed from a machine. This EWS is built to work with the Philips SureSigns VS2+ Vital Signs Monitor, but I'm working on testing it with other machines. 

== Patches and Dependencies
* The Highcharts-Js-Rails gem has been patched to allow Javascript onLoad events (for the rendering of the blood pressure carats)
* A version of wkhtmlpdf must be installed. There is a gem in the gemfile that installs this, but can occasionally play up, so a manual install is preferred.
