Description:
    Generates a Measurement:
   	The model extends from the Measurement base class
   	The migration only has a value (and standard belongs to, timestamps etc.)
   	Adds blank EWSConfig to the config file if EWS is marked true
   	Can take numeric or string fields

   	View implementation must be done manually. 

   	NAME must be in camel cased form eg. HeartRate

Example:
    rails generate measurement HeartRate -n true -e true

    This will create:
        Blank model in app/models/measurements called HeartRateMeasurement
        Migration with value as float (if -n is false, then string) heart_rate_measurements
        Adds a has_many to the Observation class 'heart_rate'
        config/ews_boundaries.yml gets blank spaces to fill out the boundaries (only if -e is true) HeartRate
